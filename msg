I have given considerable thought to my recent decision to resign, and after reflecting on the many opportunities and the supportive environment here, I've realized that my professional journey with this organization is not yet complete. I am grateful for the understanding and support shown by the team during this period of contemplation. I am excited to continue contributing to our collective goals and to grow alongside this talented team. Thank you for considering the withdrawal of my resignation.
