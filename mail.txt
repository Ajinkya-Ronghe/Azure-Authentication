Subject: Revised Leave Dates Request (June 3-13, 2024)

Dear Nishchay,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to revise my leave request due to a change in flight arrangements by our travel agency, necessitating an additional day of leave on June 3, 2024. Additionally, I wish to confirm that the NOC for an extra day of leave on June 13, 2024, for post-travel recovery has already been approved.

Therefore, my updated leave dates would now be from June 3, 2024, to June 13, 2024. This adjustment will facilitate my travel logistics and ensure adequate recovery time post-travel before resuming work.

Thank you for your understanding and support in accommodating these changes.

Best regards,
