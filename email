Dear Santhya,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for your attention to the SSP integration project.

I want to assure you that despite the public holiday on May 1st and my subsequent leave for visa processing on May 7th and 8th, significant progress has been made. The task was initially assigned to me at the end of the day on Tuesday, April 30th, 2024. Within this tight timeframe, I diligently worked on both the development and setup phases, successfully completing the local setup on my machine with crucial assistance from Pavan and Kedar.

We have not only deployed the API successfully but have also incorporated the necessary authentication measures as per the project requirements.

Currently, we are taking steps to integrate a new workflow, as recommended by Jiten.

Thank you for your understanding and support. Please rest assured that we are committed to resolving any concerns promptly and will keep you updated on our progress.

Best regards,
Ajinkya Ronghe


Dear Rajkumar,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Associate Consultant position (Job ID: 127493) listed on the internal portal. With 3.9 years of experience in the industry, I am currently seeking a position that better aligns with my career aspirations and expertise.

I have previously worked on AWS provisioning and have practical experience with Docker and Kubernetes, which I am keen to further develop. Although the portal indicates that I do not meet the criteria, I am eager to discuss how my skills and experiences can be beneficial for this role. I believe my technical background equips me well to contribute significantly to the project's success.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this opportunity in more detail?

Thank you for considering my interest.
