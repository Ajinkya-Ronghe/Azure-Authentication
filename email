Dear Santhya,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for your attention to the SSP integration project.

I want to assure you that despite the public holiday on May 1st and my subsequent leave for visa processing on May 7th and 8th, significant progress has been made. The task was initially assigned to me at the end of the day on Tuesday, April 30th, 2024. Within this tight timeframe, I diligently worked on both the development and setup phases, successfully completing the local setup on my machine with crucial assistance from Pavan and Kedar.

We have not only deployed the API successfully but have also incorporated the necessary authentication measures as per the project requirements.

Currently, we are taking steps to integrate a new workflow, as recommended by Jiten.

Thank you for your understanding and support. Please rest assured that we are committed to resolving any concerns promptly and will keep you updated on our progress.

Best regards,
Ajinkya Ronghe
