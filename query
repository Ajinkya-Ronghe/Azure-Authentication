Subject: Leave Request and Acknowledgment for Visa Application (June 4-12, 2024)

Hi Nishchay,

I hope this email finds you well. I am planning a trip to Paris and Switzerland from June 4, 2024, to June 12, 2024, and would like to formally request leave for this period. This travel is for personal reasons, and I am in the process of applying for a visa, which requires an acknowledgment of my leave from Infosys.

Could you please assist by providing a letter that confirms my employment with Infosys, the specified leave dates, and a statement affirming my return to work post-travel? This document is a crucial component of my visa application.

I assure you that I will manage my responsibilities and ensure a smooth workflow in my absence. I am also happy to assist in any way to facilitate this process before my leave starts.

Please let me know if you need any more details from my side or if there are forms and procedures I should complete as part of this request. I am aiming to submit my visa application by this week, so I would appreciate your support in providing the acknowledgment letter at your earliest convenience.

Thank you very much for considering my request.

Best regards,
Ajinkya Ronghe
